# How to replace MDX with structured content in your NextJS frontend app

# How to power a read-only blog

If you want a better way of managing content than MDX, and don’t need to provide write access to other editors, this is the guide for you.

---

Keystone’s powerful features around fields, auth, and user permissions make it a great fit for teams of all sizes.

We recently added SQLite to our list of supported databases. 🎉

In addition to everything else you’d expect, you can now use Keystone to run a local instance of Admin UI from the same place you keep your frontend, and commit all your content to Git. This approach gets you a secure read-only API in production, and the option to deploy your project to Vercel in minutes. Let’s get started…

## Setup a NextJS app

?> [RONALD] Perhaps offer a jump link for people who want to bypass all the NextJS setup? 

### Dependencies 

Start out by adding NextJS and its dependencies in an empty project directory:

```bash
yarn add next react react-dom
```

Keystone Next is built in TypeScript. Add Typescript and Prettier as `--dev` dependencies to make Keystone implementation easier later on:

```bash
yarn add --dev typescript @types/react prettier
```

### Scripts

Update the `package.json` file to include the following [NextJS CLI `scripts`](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-reference/cli) and `prettier` configuration options:

```json

// package.json

{
  "dependencies": {
    "next": "^10.2.0",
    "react": "^17.0.2",
    "react-dom": "^17.0.2"
  },
  "devDependencies": {
    "@types/react": "^17.0.4",
    "prettier": "^2.2.1",
    "typescript": "^4.2.4"
  },
  "scripts": {
    "dev": "next dev",
    "start": "next start",
    "build": "next build"
  },
  "prettier": {
    "arrowParens": "avoid",
    "proseWrap": "preserve",
    "singleQuote": true,
    "trailingComma": "es5"
  }
}
```

### Version control

Add the following to your `.gitignore` to avoid committing changes to .`.keystone` and `.next` build directories and more:

```bash

# .gitignore

# Logs
*.log
npm-debug.log*
yarn-debug.log*
yarn-error.log*

# Dependency directories
node_modules/

# TypeScript cache
*.tsbuildinfo

# Optional npm cache directory
.npm

# Optional eslint cache
.eslintcache

# Optional REPL history
.node_repl_history

# Output of 'npm pack'
*.tgz

# Yarn Integrity file
.yarn-integrity

# dotenv environment variables file
.env
.env.test

# parcel-bundler cache (https://parceljs.org/)
.cache

# Next.js build output
.next

# Keystone.js build output
.keystone
```

### Add your first page  

1. Create a `/pages` directory at the root of your project containing an `index.tsx` with with the following:

```tsx
// pages/index.tsx

export default function Home() {
  return <h1>Hello World! 👋🏻 </h1>;
}
```

!> In Next.js, a [page](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/pages) is a React Component exported from a `.js`, `.jsx`, `.ts`, or `.tsx` file in the `/pages` directory. Each page is associated with a route based on its file name.

### Startup your local server

Run `yarn dev` at the root of your project. NextJS will give you a local server at [`http://localhost:3000`](http://localhost:3000). You should see the contents of your `index.tsx` file in the browser 🎉 

![A browser showing the Home page of the new app](/assets/tutorials/next-lite/localhost-home-1.png)

Running `yarn dev` for the first time creates new items in your project folder:

```text
├── .next // new - the next app
├── node_modules
├── pages
│   └── index.tsx
├── .gitignore
├── next-env.d.ts // new
├── package.json
├── tsconfig.json // new
├── yarn-error.log
└── yarn.lock
```

### Add a blog post

Now that we have a local server up and running, let‘s extend our content with a `post` type using static files to start out. (We’ll soon be powering posts with content from Keystone.)

Add an _app.tsx file inside `/pages` to let `<link>` tags resolve:

?> [RONALD] somebody pls make this make sense ^. this is the default app code per NextJS, but links don't work without it which is surprising to my layman's eyes. 

```tsx
// pages/_app.tsx

function App({ Component, pageProps }) {
  return <Component {...pageProps} />;
}

export default App;

```

Add a `/post` subdirectory and include the following in `[slug].tsx`:

```tsx

// pages/post/[slug].tsx

import Link from 'next/link';

export default function Home() {
  return (
    <div>
      <div>
        <Link href="/">
          <a>&larr; back home</a>
        </Link>
      </div>
      <h1>My first post!</h1>
      <p></p>
    </div>
  );
}
```

And update the contents of `/pages/index.tsx` with the following:

```tsx

// pages/index.tsx

import Link from 'next/link';

export default function Home() {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Hello World! 👋🏻 </h1>
      <h2>My posts:</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <Link href="/post/my-first-post">
            <a>My first post</a>
          </Link>
        </li>
      </ul>
    </div>
  );
}
```

Running `yarn dev` again should give you an updated home page with a links between it and your first post:

## Add Keystone to your project

Let’s integrate Keystone with NextJS to blend file-based content with dynamic posts that you can edit in Keystone‘s Admin UI.

### Install dependencies

Add the following Keystone dependencies to the project:

```bash
yarn add @keystone-next/keystone @keystone-next/admin-ui @keystone-next/fields

```

### Add Keystone to NextJS config

Add a `next.config.js` file to the project root:

```tsx

// next.config.js

const { withKeystone } = require('@keystone-next/keystone/next');

module.exports = withKeystone();
```

Keystone operates completely independently of the NextJS frontend, but the `withKeystone` lets NextKJS encapsulate Keystone in the script runtime.

### Add Keystone config

Add a `keystone.ts` file to the project root. This is where we’ll setup the `Post` [list](/apis/schema) type for blog entries that can be edited in Keystone’s Admin UI:

```tsx
// keystone.ts

import { config, list } from '@keystone-next/keystone/schema';
import { text } from '@keystone-next/fields';

// Creates a `Post` list-type 
const Post = list({
  fields: {
    title: text({ isRequired: true }),
    slug: text(),
    content: text(),
  },
});

export default config({
  db: { adapter: 'prisma_sqlite', url: 'file:./app.db' },
  experimental: {
    generateNextGraphqlAPI: true,
    generateNodeAPI: true,
  },
  lists: { Post },
});
```

?> In Keystone `lists` are collections (or tables) in a document database.

### Update package scripts

Update the `scripts` object in `package.json` to include Keystone‘s `postinstall`:

```json
  "scripts": {
    "postinstall": "keystone-next postinstall", // new
    "dev": "next dev",
    "start": "next start",
    "build": "next build"
  },
```

Running `yarn dev` again does the following:

- Builds a GraphQL schema based on the configuration of `keystone.ts`.
- Builds a [Prisma.io](https://www.prisma.io/) schema (which Keystone uses to create tables in the database).
- Serves Keystone’s Admin UI at [`http://localhost:8000`](http://localhost:8000) (in addition to the NextJS frontend at port 3000).
- Adds a `postinstall` script that ensures when we install dependencies everything is OK.

?> Your Prisma and GraphQL schemas are not up to date!


	1. this first command does a few things
	
----

5. Add `keystone.ts`
	1. Exports a keystone `config` and `lists` ()
	2. We're fiundamentally sitting on top of a tool called Prisma
6. 
7. Abstract the schema into a separate folder
8. Add a speaker list to schema
9. Relate the two
10. ----
11. Get everything talking together 
12. Add the document field
	1. CMSes and React 
13. Add the graphQL API into your NextJS app
14. Vercel deploy
	1. get a live graphQL APi querying the DB hosted on Vercel

- advantage of using Keystone and Next in the same repo:
- Keystone generates a client side GQL API, but also a serverside JS api
	- 31:00
- The diff required to build a DB into a frontend react app is 
- A fully relational postgres DB behind the scenes is much more powerful than the document store approach by other companies like contentful
